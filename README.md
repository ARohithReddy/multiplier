# multiplier
Digital circuit description to perform multiplication

Data path : 
  -contains data bus,registers,couters...
  -Takes inputs which performs operations on registers(load, clear, decrease counter)
  
Control path :
  -contsins FSM(Finite State Machine) 
  -generates control signals(load, clear, decrease counter)
  
Multi_fi module consists of data part and control part.
  So that inputs and outputs can be acessed easily.




Repository contains Test benches for all modules
